## AI Agent Task Pricing

Task pricing consists of two components:

1. **Task Initialization Cost**: \$0.01 per started task
2. **Task Step Cost**: Additional cost based on the specific model used for each step

### LLM Model Step Pricing

| Model | API String | Cost per Step |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Browser Use 2.0 | `browser-use-2.0` | \$0.006 |
| Browser Use LLM | `browser-use-llm` | \$0.002 |
| O3 | `o3` | \$0.03 |
| Gemini 3 Pro Preview | `gemini-3-pro-preview` | \$0.03 |
| Gemini 3 Flash Preview | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | \$0.015 |
| Gemini Flash Latest | `gemini-flash-latest` | \$0.0075 |
| Gemini Flash Lite Latest | `gemini-flash-lite-latest` | \$0.005 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | \$0.05 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | \$0.05 |

**Browser Use 2.0** is the default — custom-trained for browser automation. 15x cheaper and 6x faster than frontier models (~3s/step vs ~8s/step).

Use it by default (no configuration needed), or pass `llm` explicitly:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
result = await client.run("...", llm="browser-use-2.0")
```
```typescript TypeScript
const result = await client.run("...", { llm: "browser-use-2.0" });
```
</CodeGroup>

### Example Cost Calculation

Using Browser Use 2.0 for a 10 step task:

- Task initialization: \$0.01
- 10 steps x \$0.006 per step = \$0.06
- **Total cost: \$0.07**

Using Browser Use LLM for a 10 step task:

- Task initialization: \$0.01
- 10 steps x \$0.002 per step = \$0.02
- **Total cost: \$0.03** (~33 tasks per dollar)

## Browser Session Pricing

Browser sessions (direct CDP access) are billed separately from AI agent tasks. **Business and Scaleup subscribers get 50% off browser session costs.**

| Plan | Hourly Rate | Per Minute |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Pay As You Go | \$0.06/hour | \$0.001/min |
| Business/Scaleup | \$0.03/hour | \$0.0005/min |

| Item | Details |
| ---- | ------- |
| Minimum charge | 1 minute |
| Billing | Charged upfront |
| Refunds | Proportional refund when stopped early |

### How Browser Session Billing Works

1. **Upfront charge**: Full amount charged when session starts based on timeout duration
2. **Proportional refund**: Unused time refunded when you stop the session
3. **Minimum billing**: At least 1 minute is charged

**Example (Pay As You Go)**: You start a 60-minute session (\$0.06 charged). You stop after 30 minutes. You receive a \$0.03 refund.

**Example (Business)**: Same scenario costs only \$0.03 upfront, with \$0.015 refund for unused time.

### Timeout Limits

All plans support up to **4 hours (240 minutes)** per browser session.

## Skill Pricing

| Item | Pay As You Go | Business/Scaleup |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Skill creation | \$2.00 per skill | \$1.00 per skill (50% off) |
| Skill execution | \$0.02 per API call | \$0.01 per API call (50% off) |
| Skill refinement | Free | Free |
| Minimum balance to create | \$2.00 | \$2.00 |
| Minimum balance to execute | \$0.10 | \$0.10 |

### How Skill Creation Billing Works

1. **Upfront charge**: Charged when you start creating a skill
2. **Refund on cancellation**: Full refund if you cancel before generation completes
3. **Refinements are free**: Iterating on an existing skill costs nothing

## Proxy Pricing

Proxy usage is charged per GB of data transferred. **Business and Scaleup subscribers get 50% off proxy costs.**

| Plan | Proxy Cost |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Pay As You Go | \$10/GB |
| Business | \$5/GB (50% off) |
| Scaleup | \$4/GB (60% off) |

<Note>
Proxy is automatically enabled when you set `proxyCountryCode` on a session. Data usage is metered and charged based on actual transfer.
