## Task is slow

- **Switch models.** Browser Use LLM is ~3s/step. Frontier models (Claude, Gemini, O3) are 6-8s/step. See [Models & Pricing](/pricing).
- **Set a start URL.** Skip navigation steps: `start_url="https://example.com/page"`.
- **Use a closer proxy.** Proxy distance adds latency. If your target site is in the US, use `proxy_country_code="us"`.

## Agent failed or gave wrong output

- **Check the live URL.** Create a [session](/guides/sessions) manually and watch what the agent does via `session.live_url`.
- **Simplify instructions.** Break complex tasks into smaller steps. Run multiple tasks in the same session.
- **Add a start URL.** Don't make the agent search for a site — send it directly there.

## Need to log in to a site

Three options, from easiest to most secure:

1. **Profile Sync** — sync your local browser cookies. One command: `curl -fsSL https://browser-use.com/profile.sh | sh`. See [Profiles](/guides/sessions#profile-sync).
2. **Secrets** — pass credentials scoped by domain. See [Authentication](/guides/authentication).
3. **1Password** — auto-fill passwords and 2FA/TOTP codes. See [Authentication](/guides/authentication#1password-integration).

## Getting blocked by a website

Stealth is on by default (anti-fingerprinting, CAPTCHA solving, Cloudflare bypass). If you're still blocked:

- **Try a different proxy country.** Some sites geo-restrict. Use `proxy_country_code` to match the target region.
- **Slow down.** Use `flash_mode=False` for more careful navigation.
- **Check if the site uses a login wall.** Use a [Profile](/guides/sessions#profiles) to authenticate first.

## How much does a task cost?

\$0.01 init + per-step cost based on model. A typical 10-step task with Browser Use LLM costs **\$0.03**. See [Pricing](/pricing) for full details.

## Rate limited (429 errors)

The SDK auto-retries 429 responses with exponential backoff (up to 10s). If you're consistently hitting limits, you may need to upgrade your plan for more concurrent sessions. See [Pricing](/pricing).
