## Profile Sync (easiest)

Upload your local browser cookies to a cloud profile. Log in locally once, then every task with that profile is already authenticated.

```bash
export BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=your_key
curl -fsSL https://browser-use.com/profile.sh | sh
```

The interactive script walks you through selecting a local browser profile and uploading it. See [Sessions & Profiles](/guides/sessions#profiles) for more on managing profiles.

## Secrets

Pass credentials to the agent scoped by domain. The agent uses them only on matching domains.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from browser_use_sdk import AsyncBrowserUse

client = AsyncBrowserUse()
result = await client.run(
    "Log into GitHub and star the browser-use/browser-use repo",
    secrets={"github.com": "username:password123"},
    allowed_domains=["github.com"],
)
```
```typescript TypeScript
import { BrowserUse } from "browser-use-sdk";

const client = new BrowserUse();
const result = await client.run(
  "Log into GitHub and star the browser-use/browser-use repo",
  {
    secrets: { "github.com": "username:password123" },
    allowedDomains: ["github.com"],
  },
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## 1Password integration

Connect a 1Password vault so the agent can autofill credentials and TOTP/2FA codes — without ever seeing raw passwords.

1. Create a dedicated vault in 1Password
2. Create a [service account token](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts)
3. Connect it at [cloud.browser-use.com/settings](https://cloud.browser-use.com/settings)
4. Pass the vault ID in your task:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
result = await client.run(
    "Log into my Jira account and create a new ticket",
    op_vault_id="your-vault-id",
    allowed_domains=["*.atlassian.net"],
)
```
```typescript TypeScript
const result = await client.run(
  "Log into my Jira account and create a new ticket",
  {
    opVaultId: "your-vault-id",
    allowedDomains: ["*.atlassian.net"],
  },
);
```
</CodeGroup>

The agent auto-fills passwords and TOTP/2FA codes from your vault. Raw credentials never appear in logs or task output.

<Info>
  **Domain restrictions:** Use `allowed_domains` with any auth method to restrict the agent to specific domains. Supports wildcards: `example.com`, `*.example.com`, `http*://example.com`.
