## Profile Sync (easiest)

Upload your local browser cookies to a cloud profile. Log in locally once, then every task with that profile is already authenticated.

```bash
export BROWSER_USE_API_KEY=your_key
curl -fsSL https://browser-use.com/profile.sh | sh
```

The interactive script walks you through selecting a local browser profile and uploading it. See [Sessions & Profiles](/guides/sessions#profiles) for more on managing profiles.

## Secrets

Pass credentials to the agent scoped by domain. The agent uses them only on matching domains.

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    from browser_use_sdk import AsyncBrowserUse

    client = AsyncBrowserUse()
    result = await client.run(
        "Log into GitHub and star the browser-use/browser-use repo",
        secrets={"github.com": "username:password123"},
        allowed_domains=["github.com"],
    )
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { BrowserUse } from "browser-use-sdk";

    const client = new BrowserUse();
    const result = await client.run(
      "Log into GitHub and star the browser-use/browser-use repo",
      {
        secrets: { "github.com": "username:password123" },
        allowedDomains: ["github.com"],
      },
    );
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

## 1Password integration

Connect a 1Password vault so the agent can autofill credentials and TOTP/2FA codes — without ever seeing raw passwords.

1. Create a dedicated vault in 1Password
2. Create a [service account token](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts)
3. Connect it at [cloud.browser-use.com/settings](https://cloud.browser-use.com/settings)
4. Pass the vault ID in your task:

<CodeBlocks>
  <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```python
    result = await client.run(
        "Log into my Jira account and create a new ticket",
        op_vault_id="your-vault-id",
        allowed_domains=["*.atlassian.net"],
    )
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    const result = await client.run(
      "Log into my Jira account and create a new ticket",
      {
        opVaultId: "your-vault-id",
        allowedDomains: ["*.atlassian.net"],
      },
    );
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

The agent auto-fills passwords and TOTP/2FA codes from your vault. Raw credentials never appear in logs or task output.

<Callout intent="info">
  **Domain restrictions:** Use `allowed_domains` with any auth method to restrict the agent to specific domains. Supports wildcards: `example.com`, `*.example.com`, `http*://example.com`.
